              We launched StockFlow with the mission of removing the common
              barriers new traders and investors face—high costs, limited
              support, and outdated tools. The name combines “Stock” and “Flow,”
              representing a smooth and accessible trading journey for everyone.

              Today, our user-friendly interface and custom-built tech aim to
              deliver a seamless experience for stock trading and investing.
